the PostgreSQL is used for DBMS.
<br>
I used a postgres container in Docker.

<br>
At first, for launching the project it is needed to run the postgres container.
<br>
Then file "appsettings.json" have to be changed for own connection string configurations.
<br>
If it is necessary add migrations by entering command "add-migration migration_name" on the Package Manager Console on VS.
<br>
Next step - enter command "update-database".
<br>
So, the database will be created.
<br>
<br>
Launch the application.
